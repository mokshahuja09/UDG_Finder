# UDG_Finder
This is an ongoing project in which I am currently developing a script to find Ultra Diffuse Galaxies. These galaxies are extremely faint and spread out, and are therefore extremely hard to find. This project aims to use Source Extractor, and find the best parameters that can help identify our fabled UDGs.
